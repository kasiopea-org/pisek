# Example and explanation of a config file for task made in pisek

# !!! Config version 3 is experimental and can be changed !!!
# TODO comments indicate future changes

# Move 'config' into a task folder

# Values beginning with ! or @ are reserved and have special meaning:
# - Only ! value is !unset, which is always invalid
# - @ values autoexpand depending on context

# Bool type switches can have the following values:
# True values:
#   - 1, True, true, t, yes, y, on
# False values:
#   - 0, False, false, f, no, n, off


[task]

version=v3
# Task version
# - v1 - Old version with a basic set of options. (default)
# - v2 - Current stable version, Added solution sections and redone test sections.
# - v3 - Current experimental version, generalized contest_type to use. More changes incoming.
# The version applies to this config file only and cannot be inherited with the use key.

# You can use 'pisek update' to update the config to the highest version.

use=organization-config
# Config to use defaults from (defaults to none)

# Values of keys are loaded in the following way:
# 1. We try to find a given (section,key) in the task config
# 2. If not found, we go to the config specified by the use key.
# 3. If we are in the topmost config, we reset to the task config and
#    try searching for the defaulting section and key of this key.
# 4. If there is no defaulting key, we either return the default value, or fail if there is none.
#
# For example, consider:
#   use=organization-config
#   ([section],key) defaults to ([default_section],key)
#   ([default_section],key) defaults to 42 if not present
# Then we search in this order:
# 1. this config,         [section], key
# 2. organization-config, [section], key
# 3. this config,         [default_section], key
# 4. organization-config, [default_section], key
# 5. If still not found, return 42
