# Example and explanation of a config file for task made in pisek

# !!! Config version 3 is experimental and can be changed !!!
# TODO comments indicate future changes

# Move 'config' into a task folder

# Values beginning with ! or @ are reserved and have special meaning:
# - Only ! value is !unset, which is always invalid
# - @ values autoexpand depending on context

[task]

# Task version
# - v1 - Old version, currently not supported. Use 'pisek update' to update to v2.
# - v2 - Current stable version, Added solution sections and redone test sections.
# - v3 - Current experimental version, generalized contest_type to use. More changes incoming

# Config to use defaults from

contest_type=cms
# Environment for which is task developed
# kasiopea (default) / cmscontest_type=cms

# Currently determines generator / judge format
# TODO: Remove this key and split to multiple ones

task_type=communication
# Task type:
# - batch (default)
# - communication

scoring=equal
# Type of subtask scoring
# - equal - all inputs should result the same
# - min   - worst input in subtask determines the result

[tests]

in_gen=src/gen
# Source code of generator (without suffix)

checker=check
# Program (without suffix) that validates inputs
# No value means no checking

out_check=judge
# Describes how to check outputs
#   - diff: checks that contestant output equals correct output (ignores whitespace) (default)
#   - judge: if there can be multiple solutions, checks with program (called 'judge')
# In communication, only judge is allowed

out_judge=judge
# Only for out_check=judge
# Source code of judge (without suffix)

judge_type=cms
# Specifies how to call judge and how judge reports result

points_above=5
points_below=7
# Upper and lower bounds on points
# Cannot be set simultaneously with points

subtasks=X10
# String describing result on each subtask:
# 1 - success
# 0 - fail
# P - partial success
# W - wrong answer
# ! - runtime error
# T - timeout
# X - any result
#
# @all - string of 11...
# @any - string of XX...
# @auto - @all if this is primary solution, @any otherwise

# Defaults for all tests
# If not specified the defaults are
source=@auto
primary=no
points=X
points_above=X
points_below=X
subtasks=@auto

# There are also keys that are specific to [all_solutions]
# and cannot be configured on a per solution basis:

stub=src/stub
# Only for C/C++ CMS tasks
# Link each solution with given program (without suffix)
# Used commonly for interactive tasks

headers=src/blecha.h
# Only for C/C++ CMS tasks
# Allow each solution to include the given headers
# Used commonly for interactive tasks

[limits]
# Resource limits for various programs: all of them are called KEY_LIMIT,
# where KEY is one of:
#   tool        Pisek tools
#   in_gen      Input generator
#   checker     Checker
#   judge       Judge
#   solve       Primary solution
#   sec_solve   Secondary solution usually subject to much less strict limits.
# and LIMIT is one of:
#   time_limit  Execution time limit [seconds]
#   clock_mul   Wall clock multiplier [1]
#   clock_min   Wall clock minimum [second]
#   mem_limit   Memory limit [MB]
#   process_limit   Maximum number of processes -- at the moment,
#           limits greater than 1 are interpreted as "unlimited".
#           Please keep in mind that killing of multiple processes
#           upon errors is inherently unreliable.
#
# Setting limit to 0 means unlimited
#
# clock_limit = max(time_limit * clock_mul, clock_min)
#               or 0 if time_limit = 0, therefore unlimited
#
# Defaults:
#  | key           | tool      | other     |
#  | ------------- | --------- | --------- |
#  | time_limit    | unlimited | 360s      |
#  | clock_mul     | 2         | 2         |
#  | clock_min     | 1s        | 1s        |
#  | mem_limit     | unlimited | unlimited |
#  | process_limit | 1         | unlimited |

[checks]
# Sections for enabling/disabling checks that task must satisfy

# Please be careful with this section as disabling checks can make
# task making into a minefield

# Values are on/off and keys defaults to these values: 

checker_distinguishes_subtasks=off
# checks that this subtasks's inputs doesn't pass checker in predecessor subtasks
# Whether one/all must not pass depends on scoring 

solution_for_each_subtask=off
# checks that a dedicated solution exists for each subtask (aside from samples)
# A dedicated solution for a subtask is one that:
# - Gets full points on this subtask and its predecessors.
# - Doesn't get full points on other subtasks.
